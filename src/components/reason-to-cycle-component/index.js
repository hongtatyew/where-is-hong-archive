            Since 2018, I've been thinking of doing something I won't regret.
            After hearing about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gearedtoinspire/" target="_blank">Jacky Hong's epic bike ride</a> from Malaysia to
            London, I thought, 'Why not give it a shot?'
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 leading-8 text-gray-700">
            I had plans for 2020, but COVID-19 came along and messed things up.
            Now that things are looking up, I'm gearing up for this adventure,
            expecting about 7 months on the road. It's not just about ticking
            tourist spots; it's about diving into countryside vibes, soaking up
            diverse cultures, and really getting what makes each place unique.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 leading-8 text-gray-700">
            I'm aiming to connect with the heart of every spot I roll through,
            embracing the pulse of the world on this wild ride.
