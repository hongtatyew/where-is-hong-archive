# Where is Hong?

Welcome to the Where is Hong UI at [whereishong.com](https://whereishong.com) read me! This project serves as a personal website designed to track Hong's whereabouts. Hong collaborated with his best friend, [Michael Mortensen](https://github.com/gimlichael), who is responsible for the [backend - Wish Journey](https://github.com/gimlichael/wish-journey). The UI is built using Docusaurus, providing an interactive and visually appealing display for Hong's journey.

## Overview

The Where is Hong UI offers a glimpse into Hong's adventures, providing a visual representation of his current location and past experiences. This collaborative effort combines the frontend design with Michael's backend expertise, resulting in a seamless and engaging user experience.
